= HashPick

Provides utility methods for hash path queries.

Hash paths can be expressed as lists of keys of these types:

* Object.
* String.
* Symbol.
* Either String or Symbol.

In addition, the general form of hash path query iteration is available in support of arbitrary path query semantics.

The methods are provided by the module {HashPick}.

The implementation is covered by an rspec test suite in the {https://github.com/hetznerZA/hash_pick HashPick repo}.
